## 📖 Overview

This project is a prototype of a full-stack application that demonstrates the power and speed of modern tools. The tech stack was chosen to offer maximum performance with minimal configuration.

  - **Backend**: [Hono.js](https://hono.dev/), an ultrafast web framework for the edge.
  - **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/), a modern and incredibly fast JavaScript runtime.
  - **Database**: SQLite through the native `bun:sqlite` module, with zero external dependencies.
  - **Frontend**: HTML, Vanilla JS, and Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for a clean and responsive interface.

It's a perfect example for learning, creating demos, or bootstrapping a new idea.

## ✨ Features

  - 🔄 **Full CRUD Functionality**: Create, read, update, and delete todos.
  - ⚡ **Reactive UI**: The interface updates in real-time after each operation, without needing complex frameworks.
  - 💾 **Data Persistence**: Todos are saved in a `todos.db` file, surviving server restarts.
  - 📦 **Zero DB Dependencies**: Uses the native and optimized `bun:sqlite` module.
  - 🔥 **Hot Reload**: Enjoy an agile development experience with Bun's native hot-reload.
  - 🎨 **Clean UI**: A responsive and minimalist interface built with Tailwind CSS.
  - 🧪 **Comprehensive Tests**: Full integration and unit test coverage for the API.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a simple monolithic architecture, where the same Bun server is responsible for serving both the API and the static frontend files.

    Database (SQLite)-->>Server (Hono): Success confirmation
    Server (Hono)-->>Browser: 201 Created + new todo

    Browser->>Server (Hono): PUT /todos/:id (Update todo)
    Server (Hono)->>Database (SQLite): UPDATE todos SET ...
    Database (SQLite)-->>Server (Hono): Success confirmation
    Server (Hono)-->>Browser: Returns updated todo

    Browser->>Server (Hono): DELETE /todos/:id (Delete todo)
    Server (Hono)->>Database (SQLite): DELETE FROM todos WHERE id=...
    Database (SQLite)-->>Server (Hono): Success confirmation
    Server (Hono)-->>Browser: Returns confirmation

## 🧪 Testing

This project includes a complete test suite using Bun's native test runner, `bun:test`, ensuring the API's reliability.

#### Test Coverage:

  - 🔄 **CRUD Operations**: Validation for all `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes.
  - ⚠️ **Error Handling**: Tests for error scenarios like invalid input (400) and resources not found (404).
  - 🔒 **Database Consistency**: Ensures the database state is correct after each operation.
  - 🤝 **Schema Validation**: Verifies that requests and responses follow the expected format.

#### Test Isolation:

Each test runs in an isolated environment. The database is cleared before and after each test to ensure there is no interference between them.

#### How to Run Tests:

```bash
# Run all tests once
bun test

# Run in "watch" mode to re-run on changes
bun test --watch
```

> ✅ 100% test coverage for API endpoints.
> ✅ Runs in milliseconds thanks to Bun's speed.
