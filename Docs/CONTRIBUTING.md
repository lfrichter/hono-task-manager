## Project Context

This project is a **Task Manager Application**. The primary goal is to provide a simple and efficient way for users to manage their tasks.

## Contribution Guidelines

To maintain code quality, consistency, and performance, please adhere to the following rules when contributing:

### 1. Code Quality and Best Practices

- **SOLID Principles**: Always use SOLID principles and other software development best practices during development. Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.

### 2. Performance

- **Performance-Oriented Development**: Strive to implement solutions with the best possible performance from the outset.

### 3. Testing

- **Mark for Testing**: For every new operation, function, or significant piece of logic, add a `TODO` comment to flag that a unit or integration test needs to be created.
  - **Example**: `// TODO: Create unit test for this operation.`

### 4. Simplicity and Design Patterns

- **Keep it Simple**: Favor simple and straightforward solutions.
- **Use Design Patterns Wisely**: Only use a design pattern if it genuinely improves the application's structure, maintainability, or scalability. Avoid over-engineering.
